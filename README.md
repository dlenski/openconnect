# OpenConnect with PAN GlobalProtect support

**You don't want this repository. It is retained only for historical purposes.**

[OpenConnect v8.00](http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openconnect-devel/2019-January/005178.html) has
now been released. (Actually, we're several versions past that at this point.)

OpenConnect v8.x includes GlobalProtect support, _as developed in this repository_, out-of-the-box.
