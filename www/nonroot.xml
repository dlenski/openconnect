<h1>Running as non-root user</h1>

<p>There are two ways that OpenConnect can run without root
privileges. The first is that it can use a tun device which is created
and configured in advance by the root user, and set to be owned by the
user who runs OpenConnect. NetworkManager uses OpenConnect in this mode.</p>

<p>The second is that it can avoid using the tun device altogether and
instead spawn a user-supplied program, passing all data traffic
through a UNIX socket to that program.  This latter option can be used
in conjunction with a userspace TCP stack such as <a
href="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/">lwip</a> to provide
SOCKS access to the VPN without giving full access to all untrusted
users and processes on the computer, and without requiring root
privileges at all.  <a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/ocproxy.git">ocproxy</a>
is one such implementation.</p>
