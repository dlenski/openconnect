<h2>How the VPN works</h2>

<p>The VPN is extremely simple, based almost entirely on the standard
HTTPS and <a href="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4347.txt">DTLS</a>
protocols. You connect to the secure web server, authenticate using
certificates and/or arbitrary web forms, and you are rewarded with a
standard HTTP cookie.</p>

<p>You then use this cookie in an HTTP <tt>CONNECT</tt> request, and can
then pass traffic over that connection. IP addresses and routing
information are passed back and forth in the headers of that
<tt>CONNECT</tt> request.</p>

<p>Since <a href="http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html">TCP
over TCP is very suboptimal</a>, the VPN also attempts to use UDP
datagrams, and will only <em>actually</em> pass traffic over the HTTPS
connection if that fails. The UDP connectivity is done using Datagram
TLS, which is supported by OpenSSL.</p>

<h2>DTLS compatibility</h2>

<p><i><b>Note: DTLS is optional and not required for basic connectivity, as explained above.</b></i></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Cisco used an old version of OpenSSL for their server,
which predates the official RFC and has a few differences in the
implementation of DTLS.
</p>
<h3>OpenSSL</h3>
<p>Compatibility support for their "speshul" version of the protocol is
in the 0.9.8m and later releases of OpenSSL (and 1.0.0-beta2 and later).
</p>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> OpenSSL 1.0.0k, 1.0.1d and 1.0.1e have introduced bugs which
break this compatibility. See the <a href="http://lists.infradead.org/pipermail/openconnect-devel/2013-February/000827.html">thread</a> on the mailing list, which has patches for each.</p>

<p>If you are using an older version of OpenSSL which predates the
compatibility, you will need to apply this patch from OpenSSL CVS:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18037">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18037</a> (OpenSSL <a href="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1751&amp;amp;user=guest&amp;amp;pass=guest">RT#1751</a>)</li>
</ul>

For versions older than 0.9.8j, some generic DTLS bug fixes are also required:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17500">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17500</a>  (OpenSSL <a href="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1703&amp;amp;user=guest&amp;amp;pass=guest">RT#1703</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17505">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17505</a> (OpenSSL <a href="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1752&amp;amp;user=guest&amp;amp;pass=guest">RT#1752</a>) </li>
</ul>
The username/password for OpenSSL RT is 'guest/guest'

<h3>GnuTLS</h3>

<p>Support for Cisco's version of DTLS was included in GnuTLS from 3.0.21 onwards.</p>
