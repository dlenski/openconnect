	<h1>GUI Tools for OpenConnect</h1>

<h2>NetworkManager</h2>

<p>Support for OpenConnect in NetworkManager has been integrated into
GNOME git and is released alongside NetworkManager's other VPN modules:
<a href="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/">
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/</a>.</p>

<p>OpenConnect is also supported in KDE Plasma NM as well as the older
widget-based NetworkManagement applet.</p>

<h2>ConnMan</h2>

<p><a href="http://connman.net/">ConnMan</a> has core OpenConnect functionality
as from version 0.48, and the corresponding support is also in the
<a href="http://meego.gitorious.org/meego-netbook-ux/meego-panel-networks">meego-panel-networks</a>
user interface. Other ConnMan UI front ends may lack VPN support.</p>
