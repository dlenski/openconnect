<h1>OpenConnect</h1>

<P>OpenConnect is a client for Cisco's <A HREF="http://www.cisco.com/en/US/prod/collateral/iosswrel/ps6537/ps6586/ps6657/product_data_sheet0900aecd80405e25.html">AnyConnect SSL VPN</A>, which is supported by IOS 12.4(9)T or later on Cisco SR500, 870, 880, 1800, 2800, 3800, 7200 Series and Cisco 7301 Routers.</P>

<P>OpenConnect is released under the GNU Lesser Public License, version 2.1.</P>

<P>Like <A HREF="http://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/~massar/vpnc/">vpnc</A>,
OpenConnect is not officially supported by, or associated in any way
with, Cisco Systems. It just happens to interoperate with their
equipment.
<P>
Development of OpenConnect was started after a trial of their "official"
client under Linux found it to have many deficiencies:
<UL>
  <LI>Inability to use SSL certificates from a <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">TPM</A>, or even use a passphrase.</LI>
  <LI>Lack of support for Linux platforms other than i386.</LI>
  <LI>Lack of integration with NetworkManager on the Linux desktop.</LI>
  <LI>Lack of proper (RPM/DEB) packaging for Linux distributions.</LI>
  <LI>"Stealth" use of libraries with <TT>dlopen()</TT>, even using
      the development-only symlinks such as <TT>libz.so</TT> &mdash;
      making it hard to properly discover the dependencies which
      proper packaging would have expressed</LI>
  <LI>Tempfile races allowing unprivileged users to trick it into overwriting arbitrary files, as root.</LI>
  <LI>Unable to run as an unprivileged user, which would have reduced the severity of the above bug.</LI>
  <LI>Inability to audit the source code for further such "Security 101" bugs.</LI>
</UL>

Naturally, OpenConnect addresses all of the above issues, and more.

<H2>Supported Platforms</H2>

OpenConnect is known to work on Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and Mac OS X
platforms, and should be trivially portable to any other platform
supporting <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TUN/TAP">TUN/TAP</a>
devices and on which <A HREF="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a> runs.
<P>
It is known to work on at least i386, x86_64, PowerPC and MIPS
processors, and should not have issues with portability to other CPUs.

<H2>Features</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>Automatic detection of IPv4 address, routes.</LI>
  <LI>Authentication via HTTP forms.</LI>
      <LI>Authentication using SSL certificates, from local file or <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module">Trusted Platform Module</A>.</LI>
  <LI><I>UserGroup</I> support for selecting between multiple configurations on a single VPN server.</LI>
  <LI>Data transport over TCP <I>(HTTPS)</I> or UDP <I>(DTLS)</I>.</LI>
  <LI>Keepalive and Dead Peer Detection on both HTTPS and DTLS.</LI>
  <LI>Automatic update of VPN server list / configuration.</LI>
  <LI>Roaming support, allowing reconnection when the local IP address changes.</LI>
  <LI>Run without root privileges.</LI>
</UL>

There are two ways that OpenConnect can run without root
privileges. The first is that it can use a tun device which is created
in advance by the root user, and set to be owned by the user who runs
OpenConnect.<P>

The second is that it can avoid using the tun device altogether and
instead spawn a user-supplied program, passing all data traffic
through a UNIX socket to that program.  This latter option can be used
in conjunction with a userspace TCP stack such as <A
HREF="http://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/lwip/">lwip</A> to provide
SOCKS access to the VPN without giving full access to all untrusted
users and processes on the computer, and without requiring root
privileges at all.


<H2>TODO</H2>
<UL>
  <LI>IPv6 support</LI>
  <LI>Windows / BSD / etc. support</LI>
</UL>

Neither of the above would be hard to implement. The first just
requires someone with access to a suitably configured server; it
should be fairly simple to see how IPv6 connectivity works. If someone
has such a machine &mdash; or has a legitimate version of IOS which
they could run in an emulator like <A
HREF="http://www.ipflow.utc.fr/index.php/Cisco_7200_Simulator">Dynamips</A>,
it would be very much appreciated to have some time to experiment with
it.

<P> The second is just a case of someone testing it on new platforms
and letting me have any patches that are required; it mostly ought to
'just work', with maybe a few system-specific modifications to the tun
support.

<H2>NetworkManager support</H2>

Support for OpenConnect in NetworkManager has been integrated into
GNOME git and is released alongside NetworkManager's other VPN modules:
<A HREF="http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/">
http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/NetworkManager-openconnect/</A>.<P>

Unlike other VPN support in NetworkManager, the <TT>auth-dialog</TT>
tool which handles GUI authentication is part of OpenConnect itself,
rather than included in the <TT>network-manager-openconnect</TT>
package. This is because it shares a lot of code with OpenConnect, but
doesn't actually share any with NetworkManager or the other parts of
the NetworkManager support.

<H2>ConnMan support</H2>

Basic support for OpenConnect in <A
HREF="http://moblin.org/projects/connection-manager">ConnMan</A> has
been submitted, and is pending approval. It can be obtained from the
git repository at
<TT>git://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/connman-openconnect.git</TT>;
browsable in <A HREF="
http://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/connman-openconnect.git">gitweb</A>.
<H2>Requirements</H2>
The basic text-mode client uses the following libraries:
<UL>
  <LI><B>OpenSSL</B> &mdash; all versions from 0.9.7 onwards will work for basic connectivity, but see note on DTLS compatibility below.</LI>
  <LI><B>libxml2</B></LI>
</UL>
Mac OS X users will also need to install the
<A HREF="http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/">Mac OS X tun/tap driver</A>.<P>

For building the NetworkManager support, you will also need:
<UL>
  <LI><B>GTK</B></LI>
  <LI><B>GConf</B></LI>
</UL>

Patches converting OpenConnect from libxml2 to something more compact like expat would be welcomed...

<H2>How the VPN works</H2>

The VPN is extremely simple, based almost entirely on the standard
HTTPS and <A HREF="http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4347.txt">DTLS</A>
protocols. You connect to the secure web server, authenticate using
certificates and/or arbitrary web forms, and you are rewarded with a
standard HTTP cookie.<P>

You then use this cookie in an HTTP <TT>CONNECT</TT> request, and can
then pass traffic over that connection. IP addresses and routing
information are passed back and forth in the headers of that
<TT>CONNECT</TT> request.<P>

Since <A HREF="http://sites.inka.de/~W1011/devel/tcp-tcp.html">TCP
over TCP is very suboptimal</A>, the VPN also attempts to use UDP
datagrams, and will only <em>actually</em> pass traffic over the HTTPS
connection if that fails. The UDP connectivity is done using Datagram
TLS, which is supported by OpenSSL.


<H2>OpenSSL/DTLS compatibility</H2>

Unfortunately, Cisco used an old version of OpenSSL for their server,
which predates the official RFC and has a few differences in the
implementation of DTLS.

Compatibility support for their "speshul" version of the protocol was
introduced into OpenSSL after the 0.9.8k release.<P>

If you are using a version of OpenSSL older than 0.9.8l, you will need to apply this patch from OpenSSL CVS:
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18037">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=18037</A> (OpenSSL <A HREF="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1751&user=guest&pass=guest">RT#1751</A>)</LI>
</UL>

For versions older than 0.9.8j, some generic DTLS bug fixes are also required:
<UL>
  <LI><A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17500">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17500</A>  (OpenSSL <A HREF="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1703&user=guest&pass=guest">RT#1703</A>)</LI>
  <LI><A HREF="http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17505">http://cvs.openssl.org/chngview?cn=17505</A> (OpenSSL <A HREF="http://rt.openssl.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=1752&user=guest&pass=guest">RT#1752</A>) </LI>
</UL>
The username/password for OpenSSL RT is 'guest/guest'

package in Fedora 11.
<H3>Debian</H3>
The <TT>openconnect</TT> package is available in Debian unstable, but <TT>NetworkManager-openconnect</TT> is not yet available.<BR>
<A HREF="http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=524982">Debian bug #524982</A> has been filed, requesting that the required patches be included in Debian's OpenSSL package.<P>
<H3>Gentoo</H3>
<A HREF="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=263097">Gentoo bug #263097</A> has been filed, asking for <TT>openconnect</TT> to be packaged.
