.SH DESCRIPTION
The program
.B openconnect
connects to Cisco "AnyConnect" VPN servers, which use standard TLS
and DTLS protocols for data transport.

The connection happens in two phases. First there is a simple HTTPS
connection over which the user authenticates somehow \- by using a
certificate, or password or SecurID, etc.  Having authenticated, the
user is rewarded with an HTTP cookie which can be used to make the
real VPN connection.

The second phase uses that cookie in an HTTPS
.I CONNECT
request, and data packets can be passed over the resulting
connection. In auxiliary headers exchanged with the
.I CONNECT
request, a Session\-ID and Master Secret for a DTLS connection are also
exchanged, which allows data transport over UDP to occur.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-config=CONFIGFILE
Read further options from
.I CONFIGFILE
before continuing to process options from the command line. The file
should contain long-format options as would be accepted on the command line,
but without the two leading \-\- dashes. Empty lines, or lines where the
first non-space character is a # character, are ignored.

Any option except the
.B config
option may be specified in the file.
.TP
.B \-b,\-\-background
Continue in background after startup
.TP
.B \-\-pid\-file=PIDFILE
Save the pid to
.I PIDFILE
when backgrounding
.TP
.B \-c,\-\-certificate=CERT
Use SSL client certificate
.I CERT
.TP
.B \-e,\-\-cert\-expire\-warning=DAYS
Give a warning when SSL client certificate has
.I DAYS
left before expiry
.TP
.B \-k,\-\-sslkey=KEY
Use SSL private key file
.I KEY
.TP
.B \-C,\-\-cookie=COOKIE
Use WebVPN cookie
.I COOKIE
.TP
.B \-\-cookie\-on\-stdin
Read cookie from standard input
.TP
.B \-d,\-\-deflate
Enable compression (default)
.TP
.B \-D,\-\-no\-deflate
Disable compression
.TP
.B \-\-force\-dpd=INTERVAL
Use
.I INTERVAL
as minimum Dead Peer Detection interval for CSTP and DTLS, forcing use of DPD even when the server doesn't request it.
.TP
.B \-g,\-\-usergroup=GROUP
Use
.I GROUP
as login UserGroup
.TP
.B \-h,\-\-help
Display help text
.TP
.B \-i,\-\-interface=IFNAME
Use
.I IFNAME
for tunnel interface
.TP
.B \-l,\-\-syslog
Use syslog for progress messages
.TP
.B \-U,\-\-setuid=USER
Drop privileges after connecting, to become user
.I USER
.TP
.B \-\-csd\-user=USER
Drop privileges during CSD (Cisco Secure Desktop) script execution.
.TP
.B \-\-csd\-wrapper=SCRIPT
Run
.I SCRIPT
instead of the CSD (Cisco Secure Desktop) script.
.TP
.B \-m,\-\-mtu=MTU
Request
.I MTU
from server
.TP
.B \-p,\-\-key\-password=PASS
Provide passphrase for certificate file, or SRK (System Root Key) PIN for TPM
.TP
.B \-P,\-\-proxy=PROXYURL
Use HTTP or SOCKS proxy for connection
.TP
.B \-\-no\-proxy
Disable use of proxy
.TP
.B \-\-libproxy
Use libproxy to configure proxy automatically (when built with libproxy support)
.TP
.B \-\-key\-password\-from\-fsid
Passphrase for certificate file is automatically generated from the
.I fsid
of the file system on which it is stored. The
.I fsid
is obtained from the 
.BR statvfs (2)
or
.BR statfs (2)
system call, depending on the operating system. On a Linux or similar system
with GNU coreutils, the
.I fsid
used by this option should be equal to the output of the command:
.EX
stat \-\-file\-system \-\-printf=%i\e\en $CERTIFICATE
.EE
It is not the same as the 128\-bit UUID of the file system.
.TP
.B \-\-key\-type=TYPE
Type of private key file (PKCS#12, TPM or PEM)
.TP
.B \-q,\-\-quiet
Less output
.TP
.B \-Q,\-\-queue\-len=LEN
Set packet queue limit to
.I LEN
pkts
.TP
.B \-s,\-\-script=SCRIPT
Invoke
.I SCRIPT
to configure the network after connection. Without this, routing and name
service are unlikely to work correctly. The script is expected to be
compatible with the
.B vpnc\-script
which is shipped with the "vpnc" VPN client. See
.I http://www.infradead.org/openconnect/vpnc-script.html
for more information. This version of OpenConnect is configured to use
.B @DEFAULT_VPNCSCRIPT@
by default.
.TP
.B \-S,\-\-script\-tun
Pass traffic to 'script' program over a UNIX socket, instead of to a kernel
tun/tap device. This allows the VPN IP traffic to be handled entirely in
userspace, for example by a program which uses lwIP to provide SOCKS access
into the VPN.
.TP
.B \-u,\-\-user=NAME
Set login username to
.I NAME
.TP
.B \-V,\-\-version
Report version number
.TP
.B \-v,\-\-verbose
More output
.TP
.B \-x,\-\-xmlconfig=CONFIG
XML config file
.TP
.B \-\-authgroup=GROUP
Choose authentication login selection
.TP
.B \-\-cookieonly
Fetch webvpn cookie only; don't connect
.TP
.B \-\-printcookie
Print webvpn cookie before connecting
.TP
.B \-\-cafile=FILE
Cert file for server verification
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-ipv6
Do not advertise IPv6 capability to server
.TP
.B \-\-dtls\-ciphers=LIST
Set OpenSSL ciphers to support for DTLS
.TP
.B \-\-no\-cert\-check
Do not require server SSL certificate to be valid. Checks will still happen
and failures will cause a warning message, but the connection will continue
anyway. You should not need to use this option \- if your servers have SSL
certificates which are not signed by a trusted Certificate Authority, you can
still add them (or your private CA) to a local file and use that file with the
.B \-\-cafile
option.

.TP
.B \-\-no\-dtls
Disable DTLS
.TP
.B \-\-no\-http\-keepalive
Version 8.2.2.5 of the Cisco ASA software has a bug where it will forget
the client's SSL certificate when HTTP connections are being re\-used for
multiple requests. So far, this has only been seen on the initial connection,
where the server gives an HTTP/1.0 redirect response with an explicit
.B Connection: Keep\-Alive
directive. OpenConnect as of v2.22 has an unconditional workaround for this,
which is never to obey that directive after an HTTP/1.0 response.

However, Cisco's support team has failed to give any competent
response to the bug report and we don't know under what other
circumstances their bug might manifest itself. So this option exists
to disable ALL re\-use of HTTP sessions and cause a new connection to be
made for each request. If your server seems not to be recognising your
certificate, try this option. If it makes a difference, please report
this information to the
.B openconnect\-devel@lists.infradead.org
mailing list.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-passwd
Never attempt password (or SecurID) authentication.
.TP
.B \-\-non\-inter
Do not expect user input; exit if it is required.
.TP
.B \-\-passwd\-on\-stdin
Read password from standard input
.TP
.B \-\-reconnect\-timeout
Keep reconnect attempts until so much seconds are elapsed. The default
timeout is 300 seconds, which means that openconnect can recover
VPN connection after a temporary network down time of 300 seconds.
.TP
.B \-\-servercert=SHA1
Accept server's SSL certificate only if its fingerprint matches
.IR SHA1 .
.TP
.B \-\-useragent=STRING
Use
.I STRING
as 'User\-Agent:' field value in HTTP header.
(e.g. \-\-useragent 'Cisco AnyConnect VPN Agent for Windows 2.2.0133')

.SH LIMITATIONS
Note that although IPv6 has been tested on all platforms on which
.B openconnect
is known to run, it depends on a suitable
.B vpnc\-script
to configure the network. The standard
.B vpnc\-script
shipped with vpnc 0.5.3 is not capable of setting up IPv6 routes; the one from
.B git://git.infradead.org/users/dwmw2/vpnc\-scripts.git
will be required.
